 * Plugin Name: Buy 3 Pay 1
 * Description: With this plugin, when you add 3 items to your cart, a discount is applied that sets the price to be equal to the price of 1 product. For example if you add 3 items that cost 10$ each, the final price will be 10$ instead of 30$. You can also make specific categories to not count in the calculation.

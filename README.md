# WordPress-Buy3Pay1-Plugin


The "Buy 3 Pay 1" plugin is a WooCommerce plugin that applies a discount to the cart when the customer adds three or more items to it. Specifically, the discount will set the price to be equal to the price of one product. For instance, if you add three items that cost $10 each, the final price will be $10 instead of $30.

Additionally, this plugin allows you to exclude certain categories from the discount calculation. This can be useful if you have some products that you don't want to be included in the promotion.

Please note that this plugin is designed for a very specific use case and may not be suitable for all e-commerce stores. It is intended for situations where you want to offer a discount to customers who purchase multiple items of a certain type or category.
